\section{Personal Reflections}\label{sec:reflection}

\subsection{Pre-Venture Reflections}

\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
  \item What are your strengths and how can you apply those strengths to benefit the team?
  \item What are your weaknesses, and how can you work on improving these on the venture?
  \item What's your go-to leadership style?
  \item What type of follower are you?
  \item Which leaders do you admire and respect?
  \item What makes them great?
  \item Think about previous team experiences, both good and bad ones. What made those teams successful? Why did the bad teams fail?
  \item What criteria would you use for a high-performing team?
  \item Who are you today?
  \item How would others describe you?
  \item How have you changed since college? Why? Who or what has influenced you to change?
  \item Who do you want to be in 5 years?
\end{itemize}

Think about pivotal moments in your past: big decisions, unique experiences, challenges you had to overcome, revelations you had, etc. What happened? Why were these moments important to you? What did you learn? How did these moments shape who you are today? How could others learn from your experiences?
